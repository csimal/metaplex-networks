# Metaplex Networks

A collection of programs demonstrating the metaplex model.

## Installation
All the files are in Julia, so you'll need to install it from [here](https://julialang.org/).

The original code in the `old` folder was reworked into a [Julia Package](https://github.com/csimal/NetworkEpidemics.jl). You'll need it to run the notebooks. To install it, simply enter the following in the Julia REPL:
```julia
] add https://github.com/csimal/NetworkEpidemics.jl
```
Several community packages are also used. You can install them by running the `install.jl` file, either by entering `include("install.jl")` in the REPL, or by running `julia install.jl` in the command line.
